# 📐 Wireframe Image Placement

To display your wireframe image in the README, please place your wireframe file:

**File Location**: `docs/images/sqwf.png`
**Current File**: `sqwf` (in images folder)

## 📝 Steps to Complete:

1. **Copy your wireframe file** to: `docs/images/sqwf.png`
   - Make sure the file has a `.png` extension
   - The README is already configured to display: `![Shopping Quest Wireframes](docs/images/sqwf.png)`

2. **Alternative file formats** (if not PNG):
   - If your file is `.jpg` or `.jpeg`, update the README image path
   - If it's a different format, convert to PNG for best compatibility

## 🎯 Current README Setup

The README now includes:
- ✅ Prominent wireframe image display at the top of the wireframes section
- ✅ Professional description of your design process
- ✅ Explanation of design decisions and implementation
- ✅ Demonstrates systematic UI/UX planning approach

## 🏆 Assessment Impact

Including your actual wireframes provides:
- **Design Thinking Evidence**: Shows planning before coding
- **Professional Process**: Industry-standard development workflow
- **User-Centered Approach**: Visual proof of user experience consideration
- **Responsive Planning**: Demonstrates mobile-first design strategy

Once your wireframe image is in place at `docs/images/sqwf.png`, it will automatically display in the README and significantly enhance your project documentation!
